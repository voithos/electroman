# Electroman Adventures

## Game vision

Electroman Adventures is a fast-paced platformer with light RPG elements. The
game takes place in a various industrial / cybertech environments, and follows
the story of Electroman, the super powered in a flashy supah-suit.

## Mechanics

The game will employ many of the standard platformer mechanics, including
(obviously) platforming, battling common enemies, and taking on large bosses.
In addition, the game will feature a few RPG elements, as well as some timing
and reaction-based mechanics.

- The player will be able to move and jump around the environment
- The player will be able to attack with various long- and short-distance
  attacks, which have different attributes
- The attacks will usually consume "charge", a continuously-regenerating
  stat, similar to stamina
- There are a few other moves that don't cause damage, but use charge for
  faster movement

### Explicit stats

- Health: decreases when damage is taken, increases when healed
- Charge: decreases when charge is used, regenerates automatically

Electroman gains experience by defeating enemies. At certain thresholds,
Electroman will "level up" and become more powerful. Specifically, the
following changes occur at level-up time:

- his maximum Health and Charge limits will be increased
- his charge regeneration rate slightly increases
- the rate-of-fire of his abilities increases

### Abilities

All abilities are acquired incrementally as the game progresses, with the
exception of the basic Lightning attack.

Attacks:

- Lightning: mid-range attack, does normal damage
- Magnetic Shield: absorbs lightning attacks, healing health; also absorbs a
  large amount of the damage from other attacks (but uses up charge)
- Electro-ball: shoots slow-moving lightning ball, limited range
- Gigantic Jet Lightning: special attack, does huge damage

Other:

- Flash: uses charge to perform a double-jump
- Zip: uses charge to zip forward a certain distance

### Enemies
